# SVGColorChanger
This is a very simple program that reads SVG files and provides a GUI to modify the colors.

Drag and Drop SVG files into the program to open them and you can save them with different filenames.

If there is an existing file, the program will fail to prompt you for an overwrite and the file will be overwritten

You can also click the SVG to PNG button to convert SVG files to PNG files. Just drag specified files into the dialog box
